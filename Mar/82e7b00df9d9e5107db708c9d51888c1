Buddha statue of Trump. Photo: Sina WeiboAfter he stepped down from office, Donald Trump might have faded away from Chinese people's minds. But instead, a statue of Donald Trump as Buddha is trending on an online shopping platform, with the slogan "make your company great again!"The statue, with Trump's contemplative face lowered, and both hands resting in its lap, is labeled by the seller on Taobao as "Trump, who knows Buddhism better than anyone." The item is priced ranging from 999 yuan ($153) to 3,999 yuan, depending on its size. The seller said that the idea of the Trump Buddha statue reminded him of Trump's slogan of "Make American Great Again" and the former US president often claimed he knew things better than anyone. So the seller adapted the idea into something auspicious for Chinese companies: "make your company great again.""Most people just bought it for fun," the seller told the Global Times, noting that they only made 100 of the statues and have already sold dozens. A buyer in Shanghai, who wished not to be named, told the Global Times that he bought one of the statues after seeing the product in a WeChat moment. "I bought it for fun and put it on my desk at home as a decoration," he said. "Trump can also be regarded as a representative of an era, and extreme egoism. Now the era has passed but I want the statue to remind me: Don't be too Trump."Global Times
