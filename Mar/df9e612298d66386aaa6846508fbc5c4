We send the injured ones to the rescue centre."In December 2020, an injured wild panda was found by patrol staff in Qinling Mountains, Northwest China's Shaanxi Province, and was sent to a wildlife rescue centre in Shaanxi Province for treatment.In April 2019, another injured male wild giant panda aged around 7 to 8 was found by a local villager in Sichuan Province, and was later captured and transferred to the rescue center for treatment. The panda was released back into the wild two months later in June.Baoxing county, located in Southwest China's Sichuan Province and known as the "hometown" of pandas, is the place where the first ever panda was spotted in the world. A total of 75 percent of the area in the county has been designated as a core preservation zone for pandas, according to the Baoxing government in 2018.
