When asked about that statement, Wang said this cooperation mechanism is not dominated by China but jointly initiated by China and CEECs, and it meets the aspiration of all the parties to seek common development.“The principle of freewill-based consultation, joint contribution, openness and inclusiveness is always upheld in advancing cooperation,” Wang said.He also added that over the past nine years since its establishment, the China-CEEC cooperation has yielded fruitful results, delivered tangible benefits to the people of all participating countries and served as a useful complement to the China-EU relations.”“We have full confidence in its prospects and stand ready to work with like-minded friends for more fruitful China-CEEC cooperation, which will also boost and invigorate bilateral cooperation between China and relevant countries,” Wang noted.
