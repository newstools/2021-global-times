Other Republican lawmakers said human traffickers were profiting from Biden's policies.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Biden had inherited "a dismantled and unworkable system" from Trump. "Like any other problem, we're going to do everything we can to solve it," she said.At a bus terminal in the border town of Brownsville late Sunday, a Guatemalan woman told AFP she had crossed the border illegally after her husband, who is already in the US, told her things may be simpler under Biden."My husband told me to come at this time," said Rubia Tabora, a 25-year-old mother of one.In February, the US Customs and Border Protection agency arrested about 100,000 people at the southern border, a 28 percent jump over January.In line with a pandemic-rooted policy adopted by Trump, who cracked down on immigration both legal and illegal as part of his "America First" doctrine, the Biden administration is deporting most of the undocumented people who arrive at the southern border.But unlike Trump, Biden has opted against expelling minors who show up unaccompanied and are filling shelters set up to hold them, with limited capacity because of the coronavirus crisis.AFP
