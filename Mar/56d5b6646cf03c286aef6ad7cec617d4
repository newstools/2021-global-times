Pope Francis arrives to lead his weekly general audience in the Paul VI hall at the Vatican on Wednesday. Wednesday Papal Audiences usually take place in Saint Peter's Square at 10 or 10:30 am and last about 90 minutes.

"We hope that it will lead to better days."The Christian community of Iraq has shrunk from 1.5 million before the 2003 US-led invasion that ousted Saddam Hussein to only 400,000 now, about 1 percent of the 40 million living in the Muslim-majority country.Most of them had been living in the vast plains of the northern Nineveh province - which IS set in its sights in 2014. Watching the horrors from afar at the time, Pope Francis said he was ready to meet the displaced and other victims of war in a show of solidarity.Seven years later, he would see for himself the devastated Old City of Mosul and the painstaking efforts to rebuild it.He would then travel east to Qaraqosh, one of Iraq's oldest Christian towns, whose residents still speak a dialect of the language spoken by Jesus Christ.It, too, was largely destroyed in 2014 when IS rampaged through the area, but its residents have trickled back since 2017 and slowly worked at rebuilding their hometown. To honor the pope, local artisans wove a two-meter prayer shawl, or stole, with the "Our Father" and "Hail Mary" prayers carefully hand-stitched in golden thread in Syriac.It was given to Francis on his first day in Iraq on Friday.AFP
