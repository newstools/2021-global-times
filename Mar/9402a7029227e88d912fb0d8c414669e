She reportedly called the police eight times but did not receive any useful help.The federation’s proposal, therefore, could be positive in prompting police stations to set up a team specifically to deal with domestic violence cases, Zhang told the Global Times on Friday.The team could consist of trained police officers who clearly know how to make a record, how to help the victims conduct injury identification and how to issue a warning to or even arrest the culprits, which is quite different from dealing with ordinary public security cases, Zhang said.The general domestic violence situation in China has improved in the past five years since the first ever Anti-domestic Violence Law took effect in March 2016, legal experts and observers told the Global Times. “But we still have a long way to go in eliminating domestic violence and pursuing real gender equality in marriage and families,” Zhang said. How frontline police officers regard and deal with domestic violence cases after receiving calls for help are critical in this process, she added.A total of 1,214 people died in the 942 cases related to domestic violence that media reports covered between March 1, 2016, when the Anti-domestic Violence Law came into effect, and December 31, 2019, according to statistics compiled by Equality, a Beijing-based non-governmental group focusing on gender-based violence in China.These media reports covered various cases involving victims who received little help after calling the police repeatedly, Guangming Daily said in an article in February, citing the Equality report.
