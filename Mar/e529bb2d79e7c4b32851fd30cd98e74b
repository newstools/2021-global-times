However, those who do go on to develop MIS-C can experience prolonged fever and severe abdominal pain and may progress to shock, according to the NIH.About 3.17 million children in the United States have tested positive for COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic, according to a latest report of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Children's Hospital Association.A total of 3,168,274 child COVID-19 cases had been reported across the country as of Feb. 25, and children represented 13.1 percent of all confirmed cases, according to the report.The overall rate was 4,209 cases per 100,000 children in the population.Over 64,000 new child COVID-19 cases were reported last week. This marked the sixth consecutive week with a decline in new cases, according to the AAP.Over the two weeks from Feb. 11 to Feb. 25, there were 134,904 new child COVID-19 cases reported across the country, an 4 percent increase.Children accounted for 1.3 percent to 3 percent of total reported hospitalizations, and 0 to 0.19 percent of all COVID-19 deaths, said the report."At this time, it appears that severe illness due to COVID-19 is rare among children. However, there is an urgent need to collect more data on longer-term impacts of the pandemic on children, including ways the virus may harm the long-term physical health of infected children, as well as its emotional and mental health effects," the AAP said in the report.The United States has recorded over 28.67 million cases with more than 515,300 related deaths as of Tuesday noon, according to the real-time count kept by Johns Hopkins University.
