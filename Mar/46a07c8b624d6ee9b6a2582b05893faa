On the third day, there was nothing left but a mild cough," Fouad Dashti, a Kuwaiti citizen who was infected with the coronavirus, told Xinhua."We hope to use such medicines in hospitals, especially as they are recommended by Chinese health experts and globally approved," he said.Another citizen, Fahd Al-Ayoubi, believes that Lianhua Qingwen is not only good for COVID-19 patients, but also for regular flu and rather for prevention.He said that he took two capsules per day after each meal to prevent catching the coronavirus, adding that he felt a warmth on his chest, which helped open his respiratory tract.Um Faisal, who was infected with COVID-19 last year, used the medicine to relieve symptoms.The capsules succeeded in relieving her symptoms and helping her regain senses, she said, adding that during the 10-day quarantine period she did not have any symptoms left.
