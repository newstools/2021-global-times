Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying Photo: fmprc.gov.cnSome politicians in countries such as Australia never really care about the truth, but are just keen on political manipulation, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson on Wednesday, urging them to self-reflect instead of "using a magnifying glass to look others" in response to those countries' defamation and attacks against China on issues related to Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region."We welcome any unbiased foreigners to visit Xinjiang, but firmly oppose any so-called 'investigation' and 'accountability' with presumption of guilt, and stand against anyone using this for political maneuver to pressure China," Hua Chunying, the spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, told the Global Times at a press conference on Wednesday.Hua made the remarks in response to a statement on Xinjiang human rights jointly published on Tuesday by Australian and New Zealand foreign ministers."I wonder how is Australia doing with those investigations into their soldiers' grave crimes in Afghanistan that were exposed not long ago?" Hua asked. "Besides, in Australia, there was the infamous White Australia Policy, under which genocide was committed against aboriginal people and 100,000 aboriginal children were forcibly taken away from their families. Did the Australian side hold accountable those who caused pain to the Stolen Generation?"The Chinese Embassy in Australia published on Tuesday a declaration to oppose the so-called statement on Xinjiang made by the Australian Foreign Minister. "We urge the Australian government to stop vilifying China, refrain from meddling in China's internal affairs and cease to apply double standards on human rights," it read."The Australian side should know very well what problems they have in history and now. They should also be clear about what concrete actions they need to take to put things right," Hua said.Hua noted that the accusations on Xinjiang from Australia and several other allies of the US are totally based on lies. "If government leaders of a country don't believe the voice of the 25 million people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang and actual situation on the ground, but rather choose to believe lies of the century fabricated by a handful of anti-China elements with the purpose of containing and suppressing China's development, do you think such things should be allowed?" Hua asked an Australian reporter."What should be done is to stop being obsessed with this issue and really reflect on themselves. If one always uses a magnifying glass to look at others, while keeping it away from themselves, they will never make any progress," she said.
