The Federal Reserve has vowed it won't raise its benchmark lending rate anytime soon, but US economists in a survey released Monday believe the central bank could be forced to enact a hike as soon as 2022.

The Federal Reserve building is seen on June 17, 2020 in Washington, DC. US central bankers are much more optimistic about the economic outlook, boosting their median growth estimate by more than two points to 6.5 percent, the Federal Reserve said March 17, 2021.

The NABE survey reports 61 percent of respondents believe inflation risks are greater than in the past two decades, while 37 percent disagree. The survey was conducted while Biden's relief plan was under consideration in Congress but before it was approved, and respondents were split over the government's overall fiscal response to the pandemic.Thirty-three percent of respondents said the government's response was adequate, a slight decrease from the previous survey in August 2020.
