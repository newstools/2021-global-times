Saudi Arabia on Monday offered Yemen's Huthi rebels a "comprehensive" UN-supervised cease-fire, as part of a series of fresh proposals aimed at ending a catastrophic six-year conflict.

The initiative includes "a comprehensive cease-fire across the country under the supervision of the United Nations," a Saudi government statement said.Riyadh also proposed reopening the international airport in Sanaa, the rebel-held capital, and restarting political negotiations between the Yemeni government and the Huthis, the statement added.The kingdom's plan also called for depositing taxes and customs revenue from ships carrying oil to the Red Sea port of Hodeida - a key conduit for desperately needed aid - in a joint account of the Yemeni central bank."We want the guns to fall completely silent," said Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan."The initiative will take effect as soon as the Huthis agree to it," he added, hailing it as "an opportunity to end the crisis" in Yemen.The Yemeni government welcomed the initiative, while the Huthis brushed it off as "nothing new" as they reiterated their demand that a Saudi-led air and sea blockade on Yemen be completely lifted."Saudi Arabia must declare an end to the aggression and lift the blockade completely," said Huthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam, according to the rebel's Al-Masirah television.Riyadh led a military coalition into Yemen in 2015 to prop up the internationally recognized government, but it has struggled to oust the highly motivated rebels. The coalition says it enforced a naval and air blockade to prevent the smuggling of weapons to the rebels from Iran - allegations Tehran denies. Saudi Arabia's proposal follows the failure of a unilateral cease-fire in 2020.In April 2020, the coalition announced a temporary cease-fire in war-wracked Yemen.
