Harbin Forestry Bureau and Administration for Industry and Commerce did not respond to the Global Times' request for comment."By using polar bears as a commercial gimmick, hotels are not only causing harm and suffering to the animals, but also increasing the risk of personal injury to tourists. It is also seriously misleading the public about the scientific knowledge of wildlife protection," Zheng Yu, an expert from World Animal Protection, told the Global Times on Wednesday. Zheng noted that in the wild, polar bears can cover a range of tens of thousands of square kilometers, while being kept in playgrounds and hotels, the lights, temperatures and facilities are unable to meet the animals' basic environmental needs. According to a survey conducted by the World Animal Protection, nearly 90 percent of tourists are willing to choose "wildlife friendly" travel.Zheng pointed out that a number of zoos in China have already cancelled wild animal shows and are actively engaged in public awareness campaigns focused on animal welfare."We expect domestic zoos, aquariums and other institutions to pay more attention to animal welfare and transform these sites into animal protection bases and nature-related education sites where humans and animals live in harmony," Zheng said.
