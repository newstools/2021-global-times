Those groups are primarily preschool through fifth grade. It's unclear when the rest will reopen, the report said.The board still needs to vote on the deal. The board's next meeting is Tuesday.It's still unclear how many of the school district's 52,000 students will return before the term ends June 2."This is an important step on our path to reopening schools. We continue to be committed to ensuring every student and family in the San Francisco United School District is receiving the support they need," San Francisco school board president Gabriela Lopez was quoted as saying.The deal came after weeks of increasingly tense negotiations. The school district and board have faced escalating pressure from parents and city officials to reopen schools.
