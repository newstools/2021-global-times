And we have had some already arrested who we would put in the category of racially motivated violent extremism, white as well," said Wray.So far at least 280 people have been arrested with more than 300 charged in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack which interrupted Congress' electoral vote count of the presidential election. Five people died in the attack, including a Capitol police officer.
