A 52-year-old Indian lingerie model is pushing e-commerce firms to hire older women for their advertising campaigns, challenging what she says are the ageist norms in many companies.

A general view of Mumbai Photo: VCGGeeta J, a former teacher who took to modeling when she turned 50, says she wants innerwear companies in India to be more inclusive and avoid featuring only younger women in their promotion drives."Are women no more fit to become a lingerie model past a certain age?" Geeta said in an online petition on change.org, captioned with the hashtags #AgenotCage and #LingerieHasNoAge. Her job is bold and unusual in the largely conservative Indian society where religious and cultural norms limit women's freedom to dress how they want.Such norms are even more restrictive for women over the age of 40, Geeta told Reuters in an interview.More than 11,000 people have signed up to support her petition, which is addressed to the chief executive of the popular innerwear company Zivame.Geeta began her career after winning a runners-up prize in a beauty pageant for older women. While her family and friends have been supportive, she said she was aware many Indian women her age would find it hard to do so."I want to tell this to all women that they should care about the dreams of their husbands and loved ones and support them, but they should never think that their own life is not important or their wishes are not important," Geeta said.
