According to media reports, adidas, together with US-based Nike, saw their market value drop by over 70 billion yuan ($10.7 billion) on that day. The market value of H&M also slumped about 4.8 billion yuan.Reputation crisisOver 40 Chinese celebrities have immediately rescinded endorsement contracts with those brands. Standing against 1.4 billion consumers, a swath of foreign brands have slipped into a reputation crisis in China.“Converse and adidas are among my favorites, now they have left me no choice but to remove them from my choices, as there’s no compromising space in front of national dignity,” Terry Xu, a 28-year-old Shanghai-based IT engineer, told the Global Times on Saturday.“I feel offended and think it’s incomprehensible that these firms operating and thriving in China for decades chose to crack down on materials produced in China with simply cooked-up rumors,” Xu said, stressing that if these foreign brands still think they can have their way in China, they are doomed.Firms can never succeed if they have no basic respect for local markets and consumers, Zhang said. For a long time, these brands have expanded fast in the Chinese market and the market correspondingly has offered increasingly strong support for their growth.However, the market is also evolving swiftly in various areas. For instance, Chinese domestic brands have been growing rapidly within the strongest manufacturing power. The brand value of Li Ning, Anta and many other Chinese brands have been soaring, especially in recent years.At the same time, Chinese consumers are changing significantly as well. With the size of the middle-income population surging, a historical win of completely alleviating poverty, and the younger generation born after 1995 becoming a major consumption power in China, their shopping preferences have become unprecedentedly diversified. And the younger generations’ preference for domestic fashion brands which contain Chinese traditional culture is extremely high, Zhang said.Lost prosperityAs the only major economy which is expected to register growth in 2020, China has nearly been a life saver for some multinationals against the backdrop of the sudden onslaught of the once-in-a-century COVID-19 pandemic. As for Nike, the Chinese market is where the company recorded its only growth in the 2020 fiscal year, with sales in the region reaching $6.68 billion, according to the company's financial report.Many foreign brands have offered rosy forecasts of their revenue growth in China in 2021, as the country will continue to boost the global recovery during the post-COVID era. For instance, adidas was expecting 20-30 percent growth in the region in 2021, according to the company's financial report.However, not only will the growth prospects be offset by the companies’ unwise choice to be involved in the vicious political scheme, they may face an irreversible situation in the world’s second largest economy. It is now a fully competitive market in China, and once a firm loses its slice of the market share, another one will swiftly slip in, not to mention these brands are facing a generation, as mentioned earlier, who possesses a high preference for domestic fashion brands, Zhang said.Under such circumstances, the reduced value in capital markets is only one part of their losses. What’s more important is that they may never win their reputation back amongst the colossal Chinese market while growth prospects are extremely vital for any company, Zhang noted.The promising Chinese market will continue to offer chances for both domestic and foreign businesses, but its people will never accept those firms trying to collect money in the market while viciously slandering China.On Saturday, the China Cotton Industry Alliance (CCIA) vowed to cultivate a high-quality cotton industrial chain, promoting the green and sustainable development of the cotton industry in Xinjiang, and to level up global influence of China’s home-grown cotton brands.CCIA condemned the fabricated rumors, clarifying that there has never been any so-called forced labor in Xinjiang. As the largest producer and consumer of cotton, China produced about 6 million tons of cotton in 2020, still 2 million tons short of the country’s total demand, according to a statement sent to the Global Times from the body on Saturday.Xinjiang produces about 5.16 million tons of cotton, accounting for over 85 percent of the nation’s total output. The CCIA said over 90 percent of cotton fields in northern Xinjiang have been fully mechanized, and the mechanization of cotton harvesting in southern Xinjiang is also increasing year by year.
