EU headquarter Photo: ICShortly after the European Union and several other Western countries imposed sanctions targeting China over alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang region, Chinese embassies in at least seven countries - Canada, Australia, UK, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and Denmark - have lodged stern representations with local authorities, refuting rumors and lies about Xinjiang-related issues. The Chinese ambassadors to these countries pointed out that the sanctions imposed by the EU and the countries were based on lies and false information about Xinjiang. "Do not play the role of 'a human rights preacher' any more, and do not go further down the wrong path," Tan Jian, envoy to the Netherlands, said in a statement published on the embassy's website on Wednesday. The sanction has disregarded and distorted facts, meddled with China's internal affairs, and breached international law and basic norms of international relations, said Tan.Ambassador to Belgium Cao Zhongming stated on Tuesday that the countermeasures taken by China to sanction 10 European personnel and four entities is a just move that defends China's legitimate rights and interests."China never provokes, but will never back down from provocations," Ambassador Wu Ken in Germany added, calling on Europe to correct its wrong course that will cause further damage to mutual trust and bilateral cooperation. In an article published on its official website, the spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in India also issued a solemn statement over remarks by local media that spread lies about so-called "genocide," "forced labor" and "suppression of religious freedom" in Xinjiang. Commenting on certain countries' incessant efforts to discredit China's counter-terrorism and de-radicalization efforts in Xinjiang, the embassy in India said those countries have fabricated the "lies of the century," which were "ugly farces directed by a handful of colluding individuals" in Western countries. In the past four years and more, there has not been one terrorist incident in Xinjiang, showing our policy in Xinjiang is correct, Chinese Ambassador to Switzerland Wang Shiting said on Wednesday. Following the EU's first ever sanctions against China in 30 years, China hit back with tit-for-tat countermeasures by sanctioning 10 individuals and four entities in Europe which have spread rumors and lies about Xinjiang.
