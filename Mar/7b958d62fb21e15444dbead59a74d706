World Athletics has marked International Women's Day with a series of pledges to "further advance the role of girls and women" in the sport under the campaign slogan "WeGrowAthletics."The world governing body says it is focusing on three core areas of the sport - empowering women in leadership positions, breaking with traditions and shining a spotlight on women's stories across its platforms.

Lisanne de Witte of The Netherlands and Marit Dopheide of The Netherlands exchange sticks in the Women's 4x400m Relay final during the European Athletics Indoor Championships 2021 at Torun Arena on March 7, 2021 in Torun, Poland Photo: VCGWorld Athletics appointed its first female vice president in 2019 and increased female Council representation to 30 percent and says it is committed to making that 40 percent by 2023 as well as an equal balance by 2027.The Monaco-based organization has also said it is reviewing traditions around the presentation of women's performances and achievements where there is currently often an unconscious bias.To mark that, the next edition of the world championships, in Oregon in the US in 2022, will conclude, for the first time, with a women's event and results will no longer be automatically presented "men first."World championship and Olympic programs have usually signed off with the men's 4x400-meter relay.The "landing page" for the organization's website will also change so that the default is no longer men's results, rankings or awards."Gender equality should no longer be a theoretical discussion in any organization," World Athletics President Sebastian Coe said in a statement."We should all be taking action by identifying barriers, reviewing our policies and practices and creating clear pathways for women to rise, contribute and participate at all levels."Athletics has historically led the way in gender equality since the beginning of the professional sport era in the 1980s with an equal program of events and prize money for both women and men."We want the strides we have made in our sport, thanks in most part to trailblazing women on and off the field of play, to inspire others."We have much more to do but I am confident these pledges, together with those of our partners and stakeholders, will allow more women to hurdle historically established barriers on the way to greater gender equality."
