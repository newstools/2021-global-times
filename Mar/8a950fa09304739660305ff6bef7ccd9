Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, testifies at a House subcommittee hearing in Washington, D.C., the United States, on July 31, 2020.(Photo: Xinhua)The US' top pandemic advisor said Sunday that authorities were considering cutting social distancing rules to 3 feet (1 meter), a move that would change a key tenet of the global fight against COVID-19.Anthony Fauci, a world-respected figure during the coronavirus crisis, said experts at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) were examining a Massachusetts study that found "no substantial difference" in COVID-19 cases in schools observing 6-foot and 3-foot rules.Asked on CNN's "State of the Union" show whether that meant that a 3-foot separation was sufficient, Fauci replied, "It does, indeed.""The CDC is very well aware that data are accumulating making it look more like 3 feet are OK under certain circumstances," Fauci added.While cautioning that the CDC was still weighing the data and conducting its own tests, he said its findings would come "soon."The six-foot social distancing rule has been a widely-adopted global measure to prevent the spread of coronavirus, along with mask-wearing and hand-washing.School officials across the world are under pressure to fully reopen as soon as safely possible, but many say the six-foot requirement makes it difficult without adding portable classrooms or shortening the school day.Many teachers unions have also insisted on 6-foot distancing.Policies on reopening schools and businesses have varied sharply around the globe as governments try to balance quelling infections with a return to normal life.The study led by the Beth Deaconess Medical Center in Massachusetts, surveying 251 school districts, found "no substantial difference in the number of cases of COVID-19 among either students or staff" between those observing the 3- and 6-foot rules when all wore masks.The findings, published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, add to a growing body of evidence that COVID-19 transmission rates are low in schools.A 3-foot rule would have an enormous impact on prospects not only for fully reopening schools, but also for offices and even public areas.AFP
