Very few game companies can reach this scale of users," he said.In addition to hardcore design, the domestic games also pay much attention to the user-centered experience and cultural exports."Games based on Chinese culture are easily recognized by users from the Asian culture circle, for example those from Japan and Southeast Asia," Sun said.
