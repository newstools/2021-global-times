Similar restriction measures are also in place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.On Feb. 22, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his long-anticipated "roadmap" exiting the lockdown. Schools in England will reopen from March 8 as the first part of the four-step plan, which Johnson said was designed to be "cautious but irreversible".
