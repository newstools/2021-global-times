Now, with the poverty alleviation drive, the region's 3.5 million people are ushering in a moderately prosperous life. It is a historic leap in their way of life, the regional chairman said."Today, the foundation for our development is more solid than ever, development opportunities are better than ever, and the momentum of development is stronger than ever," he said.Tibet now has railway, aviation, and highway transport. Water supply, power grids, and the Internet have entered villages and households, Qizhala said, adding that it is a far cry from the old days.
