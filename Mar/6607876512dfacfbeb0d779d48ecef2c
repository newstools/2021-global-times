China EU trade Photo:VCGThe first locally cleared and assembled freight train under the China railway express connecting China and Europe set off south Xinjiang on Monday, according to media reports. The train carrying a total of 82 containers departed from stations in Korla, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, carrying a total of 1,600 tons of agricultural products. The products will travel through Khorgas port toward its final destination in Georgia, located at the intersection between Eastern Europe and Western Asia. The direct train between China and Europe means that products can be locally assembled, ensuring a timely shipping, and can save time and cost on the shipping process. According to Hu Jiubin, a local official, the freight train under China Railway express can reduce shipping cost by around 200,000 yuan ($30,437) per train, and is an important channel for local products to travel to international markets. China Railway is currently expanding capacity of border ports including Khorgas port in Xinjiang and Erenhot port in North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, by building new arrival and departure lines, replacement lines and loading and unloading facilitiesOver the past few months, as shipping freight rates have largely increased due to a container shortage created by a backlog at foreign ports, the transport time and fees of the train remain relatively stable.Despite congestion abroad, trains only take 18 days to arrive in Germany, compared to around 35 days by sea.Global Times
