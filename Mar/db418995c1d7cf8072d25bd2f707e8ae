We definitely don't want that to happen."Over 114 million vaccine doses have been distributed across the United States as of Friday, and more than 85 million doses have been administered, CDC data show.More U.S. states have announced decisions to drop mask mandates despite emerging coronavirus variants, drawing criticism from experts.A total of 2,753 infection cases of coronavirus variants had been reported in the United States as of Thursday, according to the CDC.The vast majority of these cases, 2,672, were caused by the variant known as B.1.1.7, which was originally detected in Britain.There were 68 cases of a new strain initially discovered in South Africa, called B.1.351, and 13 cases of the P.1 strain first discovered in Brazil.Modeling data suggest that B.1.1.7 could become the predominant variant in the United States in March.Experts are also concerned about some worrisome variants that are in places like California and New York.The variant in California, known as B.1.427/B.1.429, spreads more easily than its predecessors and is now dominant in the state, according to scientists at the University of California, San Francisco.Studies are underway to determine whether variants cause more severe illness or are likely to evade immunity brought on by prior illness or vaccination, according to the CDC.
