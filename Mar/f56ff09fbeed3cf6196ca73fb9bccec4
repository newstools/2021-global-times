 The State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office on Tuesday voiced its firm support for the Hong Kong electoral reform plan, which was just approved by China's top legislature, saying the reform will root out risks of "color revolutions" incited by external forces and their political proxies. The Office noted that the amendments fixed loopholes and deficiencies in the current election system of the HKSAR, and systematically improved the methods for selecting the Chief Executive and the HK Legislative Council. The electoral reform firmly guarantees that patriots govern Hong Kong, said the statement, adding that the reform can root out the risks of "color revolutions" incited by external forces and their political proxies, and help Hong Kong shake off the endless political disputes and growing pressures under radical forces. The HKSAR government will amend local laws based on decision and revisions made by the top legislature, organize and manage electoral activities in accordance with law, the statement read. Whether it is enacting the National Security Law for Hong Kong, or improving the electoral system, there is only one purpose - ensuring that the "one country, two systems" principle is not deformed or bent out of shape, and is being unwaveringly carried out, the Office stressed. Hong Kong is ushering in a new era where the rights and freedoms enjoyed by local residents will be more thoroughly protected. Through greater harmony, Hong Kong's position as an international financial, trade, and shipping hub will be reinforced, and various deep-seated problems that have plagued the region will be effectively resolved. Global Times
