It is the world's first large-scale on-site international conference in 2021 thanks to the effective virus prevention measures in China, having attracted around 2,000 participants."It is generally believed that strengthening global governance is more important and urgent than ever. With the flow of production factors blocked, the BRI cooperation has promoted economic recovery in Asia and adjacent regions, demonstrated the determination of Asian countries to promote international cooperation, and also provided an 'Asian perspective' for improving global governance," Li said.Two new modules - "Explore China" and "BRI Cooperation" are set up this year on the current situation, which is in response to the general interest of the public to deepen understanding of the host country, China.The remaining four modules of "understand the changing world," "embrace the industrial changes," "dance with new technologies" and "development for all" will focus on macro topics, industry-specific issues, cutting-edge technology and sustainable development, respectively.Li noted that facing the complex international environment, only by practicing multilateralism with a developmental perspective and strengthening global governance, can we effectively respond to global challenges and ensure that all countries and regions share the fruits of development.Carbon neutrality and climate change are among the important agendas of the international community, and many countries in Asia, including the host country China, attach great importance to it. It is hoped the annual conference can build consensus and promote pragmatic cooperation.The 2020 BFA annual conference was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Founded in 2001, the BFA is a non-governmental and non-profit international organization committed to promoting regional economic integration and bringing Asian countries closer to their development goals.Global Times
