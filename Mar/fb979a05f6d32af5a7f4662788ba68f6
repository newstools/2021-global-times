Sanya, Wuxi and Lhasa are among tourists' favored domestic destinations.By March 9, hotel bookings for the Tomb-sweeping Day holiday in early April had increased to 4.5 times the number of bookings seen on the same date a year earlier.The number of hotel reservations on May 1, the first day of the five-day May Day holiday, has exceeded the number from the same day in 2019, the data showed.Beijing has relaxed COVID-19 restrictions as the Chinese capital has seen no new locally transmitted cases for over a month.Those traveling from domestic low-risk areas and arriving in Beijing are not required to provide negative nucleic acid test results, and taxi and online car-hailing services between Beijing and other cities will resume.Temperature checks will also be unnecessary at community and village entrances, while indoor and outdoor cultural and entertainment venues such as parks, scenic spots, libraries, museums and theaters will be allowed to hold up to 75 percent of their visitor capacities.Data showed soaring air and train ticket bookings in and out of Beijing immediately after the announcement from the municipal government.Industry insiders said people are using the coming holidays to make up for the trips they missed earlier.The costs of travel, accommodation and entrance tickets to cultural and entertainment venues have declined significantly since the outbreak of COVID-19, and some local governments may continue offering travel vouchers to attract tourists, allowing people to take highly cost-effective vacations this year, said Ma Yiliang, an analyst with the China Tourism Academy.According to a report from the academy, an estimated total of 4.1 billion domestic tourist trips will be made in China this year, up 42 percent from 2020.Domestic tourism revenue is expected to surge 48 percent to reach 3.3 trillion yuan (about 507.47 billion U.S. dollars), read the report.China's economic growth gathered steam in the first two months of 2021, with major economic indicators such as industrial output, retail sales and fixed-asset investment all surging more than 30 percent, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday.
