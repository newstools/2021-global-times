Outside the BBC headquarters in Portland Place, London Photo: AFPThe Chinese Embassy in the UK has refuted the false reports aired by BBC Radio 4 and strongly condemned its groundless accusations against China on issues related to COVID-19, diplomacy and other matters. The embassy spokesperson on Thursday published a letter to the BBC Radio 4, which had already been sent to the program before the broadcast of the report on Tuesday, to express strong dissatisfaction with its content and urged it to correct its mistakes. In the letter, the spokesperson pointed out and dismissed five aspects that BBC Radio 4 falsely reported on in a report titled The Disinformation Dragon. These aspects involved COVID-19 origin-tracing, Twitter's taking down of accounts attributed to China, Tiktok, Internet security and "Wolf Warrior" diplomacy. On the matter of COVID-19 origin-tracing, the embassy stressed the openness and transparency that China has kept on the matter and the support it provided for the WHO experts' trip to Wuhan. It reiterated China's position, urging other countries to follow China's example to act in a positive, science-based and cooperative manner and inviting WHO experts in for origin-tracing study, as clues, reports and studies have shown that the COVID-19 infections broke out in multiple places worldwide in the latter half of 2019.As for the so-called "Wolf Warrior" diplomacy, the embassy said China's diplomatic action is purely to stand up for itself and firmly defend its national interests and dignity when faced with the constant smears and interference into China's domestic affairs. Such behavior is totally different from being assertive, it said. The embassy in the letter urged BBC Radio 4 to abandon its bias against China, correct its mistake and report China in an objective, fair and balanced manner. Global Times
