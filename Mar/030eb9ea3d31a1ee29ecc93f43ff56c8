I think doing a fun sport like dragon boat is really a great way for the two peoples to meet each other in a friendly way," Henrywoo Hon, a businessman from Hong Kong, said.Egyptian dragon boat athletes were enthusiastic about the establishment of the EDBF, vowing to demonstrate a distinguished performance in all upcoming dragon boat championships."We have been looking forward to the establishment of an Egyptian federation for dragon boat for years, and we're happy it has finally come true," said Tarek Sami, a 26-year-old athlete, on one of the dragon boats.The paddlers on both sides of the dragon boat were all men, except Marwa Mohamed, who acted as the team's drummer.The young woman described dragon boating as "a very beautiful and enjoyable sport that teaches cooperation and unity," noting that she has been exercising it for three years."Dragon boat is not just a matter of sports, but it is a matter of cultural exchange and many other things," the lady drummer added.
