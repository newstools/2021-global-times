By developing the domestic market, China will provide great opportunities for foreign capital, products and services.However, promoting opening-up requires joint efforts by all countries and meeting one another, Li said. He gave the example of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which is comprised of countries that have different social systems, cultural customs and development stages."This shows that only based on mutual respect and equal treatment, can countries achieve consensus and common interests, helping promote the well-being of peoples, and stabilize industry and supply chains to inject momentum into the global economy," Li said."We hold an active and open attitude to both multilateral and bilateral mechanisms, if they are beneficial for mutual benefits," Li said.Experts said the statement was a rebuke to forces promoting decoupling and trade friction, and the statement was a vote of confidence on open global cooperation. China will continue to improve its market-oriented, world-class business climate, governed by a sound legal framework, and expand market access for foreign investors, said Li.
