The Trump administration insisted it was in the best interests of the United States to ensure immigrants could be self-sufficient."Immigrant families can now access life-saving health care, food, and housing assistance for which they are eligible without fear that they will lose the chance to obtain lawful permanent residence, because the actions today mean that the harmful Trump public charge rule will again be blocked," the Legal Aid Society, Catholic Legal Immigration Network Inc. and others who had challenged the rule said in a release on Tuesday.The Biden administration has taken a similar posture in other major immigration cases, convincing the Supreme Court to cancel hearings on cases challenging Trump's border wall and his changes to the asylum process, according to the report.
