(Xinhua/Tang Lu)Sri Lanka will ban the wearing of the burqa and shut more than a thousand Islamic schools, a government minister said on Saturday, the latest actions affecting the country's minority Muslim population.Minister for public security Sarath Weerasekera told a news conference he had signed a paper on Friday for cabinet approval to ban the full-face covering worn by some Muslim women on "national security" grounds."In our early days Muslim women and girls never wore the burqa," he said. "It is a sign of religious extremism that came about recently. We are definitely going to ban it."The wearing of the burqa in the majority-Buddhist nation was temporarily banned in 2019 after the bombing of churches and hotels by Islamic militants that killed more than 250.Later in 2019, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, best known for crushing a decades-long insurgency in the north of the country as defense secretary, was elected president after promising a crackdown on extremism.Rajapaksa is accused of widespread rights abuses during the war, charges he denies.Weerasekera said the government plans to ban more than a thousand madrassa Islamic schools that he said were flouting national education policy."Nobody can open a school and teach whatever you want to the children," he said.The Sri Lankan government's moves on burqas and schools follow an order in 2020 mandating the cremation of COVID-19 victims - against the wishes of Muslims, who bury their dead.Reuters
