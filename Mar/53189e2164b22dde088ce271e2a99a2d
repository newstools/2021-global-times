With none riding to Tanden's rescue, the nomination collapsed.Joining Manchin in the spotlight is another moderate Democrat, Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.With the chamber evenly split, Biden needs these new powerbrokers, and the rest of the Democratic caucus, to unite on nominations and critical pieces of legislation if they do not earn any Republican support.AFP
