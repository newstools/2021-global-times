On the endangered breed list of local livestock and poultry genetic resources, eight breeds have become extinct and 25 species are endangered, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.Breeding pigs are vividly dubbed "pig chips" because of their connection to the safety of the supply of commercial pigs, just as semiconductors are to technology, amid the nation's aim to grasp core technologies instead of being exposed to the risks of being hit by others, some industry observers have suggested.Qin Yinglin, a national lawmaker and chairman of Muyuan Foods, one of China's largest hog producers, suggested during this year's two sessions that top companies in the industry should play a leading role, increase the rate of core species origins, and include research on the disease resistance of pigs and genetic mechanisms in the national special plan.China has promoted independent innovation to ensure its livestock and poultry breeding resources, with the self-sufficiency ratio of key livestock and poultry breeds exceeding 75 percent, said Qin Yuchang, director of the Institute of Animal Science under the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, at a press conference in January.Meanwhile, Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the risks posed by African swine fever. In the latest move, Sichuan, the biggest producer of pork, issued a ban on the transportation of live pigs from out of the province through illegal channels and vowed to severely punish those who violate the rules, according to news reports on Sunday.Last week, China banned all imports of pigs, boars and related products from Malaysia after it detected its first African swine fever outbreaks last month.
