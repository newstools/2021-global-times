In May 2015, the Barack Obama administration officially removed Cuba from the list, clearing a major obstacle to re-establishing diplomatic ties between the former Cold War rivals.Bilateral ties have significantly deteriorated since Donald Trump took office in 2017. The Trump administration rolled back the detente by stepping up economic sanctions against Cuba and sought to prevent Havana's support to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, whom Washington is openly seeking to oust from power.In addition to Cuba, the State Department currently lists Syria, Iran, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as state sponsors of terrorism.
