The remaining three suffered lighter injuries.Local resident Olivia Strandberg told broadcaster SVT she didn't see the actual attack but witnessed the man being taken away, from her window just as she returned home from work."I had just gotten to my apartment when my best friend wrote me and said: Don't go out!" Strandberg said, with the broadcaster showing footage of the suspect being taken away in an ambulance on a quiet street. Speaking at a press conference, regional police chief Malena Grann later clarified that a preliminary investigation was still under the designation "attempted murder," but details had emerged that meant they were also looking into "potential terror motives."AFP
