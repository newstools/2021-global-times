I don't think the British are racist, I think Los Angeles is racist, California is a racist, but I don't think the Brits are," Markle told ITV."The thing about what colour will the baby be or how dark will the baby be; I'm guessing and hoping it's just a dumb question from somebody ... It could be somebody asked a stupid question. Rather than being a total racist.""This whole thing about color and how dark the baby is is bullshit," Markle said. He thought that the comment should be investigated.Markle and his daughter have been estranged since her marriage to Prince Harry in 2018. Markle, a former lighting director for US TV soaps and sitcoms, pulled out of the wedding days beforehand after undergoing heart surgery.He said his daughter had let him down while he was ill. "I was in a hospital bed the last time we talked and I never heard from them again - they didn't care if I died."Asked about the interview Meghan and Harry gave to Oprah Winfrey, Markle said "they went way over the top," and should have waited, considering that Queen Elizabeth II's husband Prince Philip was in hospital."They should have waited considering the queen's age and Philip's age," Markle said.Reuters
