Convicts who have committed serious crimes such as intentional homicide, rape, kidnapping, arson, organized violent crimes, drug trafficking, endangering national security and terrorist activities should not be covered by the amnesty. Those who have been pardoned but sentenced again for crimes, those who do not confess and repent of their crimes, and those who are assessed to be dangerous should also not be pardoned, Zhu said.China has had nine prisoner amnesties since the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC), with the most recent one in 2019, ahead of the PRC's 70th anniversary. In 2019, nine categories of prisoners were pardoned, including convicts who fought in the anti-Japanese war in World War II, those aged over 75 and with serious physical disabilities, and those who had previously been named model workers, according to state media Xinhua News Agency.
