Japan's 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster has not harmed the health of local residents 10 years on, according to a report published on Tuesday by UN researchers.

In a statement, the UN said the latest report had firmed up the 2013 research on the effects of radiation. UNSCEAR said that a sharply higher rate of thyroid cancers detected among children exposed to the radiation was likely due to better diagnostics.The UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), also said that there was no evidence that the disaster had had any detrimental effects on people's health."Though the ensuing damage caused nuclides to be released into the environment, scientists have found no evidence that this caused radiation-induced health effects," said head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi. However, "an important lesson of Fukushima is that regulators must be strong, independent and adequately resourced," he said.
