We have all along been waiting for this opportunity and now that it has come, and I decided to take advantage of it. I didn't want to wait a day and before you realize the vaccines are finished so I decided to take it on the first day to make sure I get vaccinated." he said.An information health officer with the Greater Accra regional health directorate Bright Obeng Amoako explained he did not entertain any fear once the vaccine had been approved by the relevant state authorities. "There is nothing bad that went through my mind because it's a vaccine and we need to take. This is something that is approved by the Ghana Health Service and the Food and Drugs Authority. I felt normal to take this vaccine."Ghana became the first country to take delivery of some 600,000 AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines from the COVAX Facility last week.The country's Food and Drugs Authority has so far declared the AstraZeneca and Sputnik vaccines as safe-for-use in the fight against the virus.
