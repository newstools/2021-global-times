Some of them even tipped each other off and deleted data to avoid detection. Huang stressed the important role that steel and iron enterprises played in air pollution control and vowed to crack down on their violations of laws and regulations.Hebei environmental authorities also sent supervision groups to each city on Friday to carry out local pollution response work. Tangshan launched a level-II emergency response to heavy pollution on March 7, which is yet to be lifted. The city government later issued a notification requiring key industrial enterprises, such as steel and iron, coking and cements enterprises, to reduce production and emissions. The air pollution has also affected other regions in the northern parts of China. At least seven provinces and municipalities have issued weather alerts for heavy pollution as of Sunday, including Beijing and Tianjin, the neighboring cities of Hebei.
