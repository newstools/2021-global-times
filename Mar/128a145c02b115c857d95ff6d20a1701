"Nowadays, we have none of them. Instead, we import them from Russia." "Not only did the red king crab from Alaska become a trade war victim, lobsters from northeastern US states as well as brown crabs were all affected," the person said. "All because of the trade war."According to the ADN, nine out of 20 surveyed key Chinese importers that brought in Alaska seafood in 2020 did not import any Alaska seafood in 2021, and did not apply for exclusions for tariffs, due to the uncertainty from bilateral ties.For timber, China has placed a 20-percent tariff, and local jobs have been shed as a result, according to the ADN.Chinese experts pointed out that on the matter of tariffs, China is patient.China will not make any positive moves on tariffs, given China has now taken more efforts on its "dual circulation" strategy to boost market demand, Tian Yun, vice director of the Beijing Economic Operation Association, told the Global Times Friday. China's "dual circulation" development paradigm, in which domestic and overseas markets reinforce each other, puts the domestic market in front.The Chinese market has many alternatives to Alaska seafood imports, and other countries are also strengthening their exports to China as US dollar liquidity is expected to tighten in the coming days, and China will have more countries for seafood imports.In 2020, Alaska also exported crude oil to China. A Bloomberg report in December indicated the state exported 15.6 million barrels in 2020, citing data.
