Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam delivered a speech at the inauguration ceremony of China Federation of Literacy and Art Circles Hong Kong Member Association in Hong Kong, south China, Nov. 18, 2020. (Xinhua/Li Gang)Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam vowed to directly oversee the SAR's three Legislative Council (LegCo) elections in the coming year to guarantee there is no foreign intervention, after the city officially adopts electoral reform in March. "The government must do a good job in the next three elections over the next 12 months," Lam stressed in a recent interview with local newspaper Ta Kung Pao, adding that time is very tight but the work is too important, so she will personally supervise every part of the elections.Amendments to more than 20 pieces of primary and subsidiary legislation are expected to take place in the coming year, part of which is to "trigger the whole body," Lam said, adding "This is an important ordinance requiring flexible time to consider."Lam also said that the future election work in Hong Kong will not rely solely on the Returning Officer, but on a qualifications reviewing committee. There will be multiple members on the committee, and its status will be higher than the Returning Officer for making decisions.The National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, passed the decision on improving the HKSAR's electoral system in a landslide vote on March 14, clearly stating their determination to carry out the reform.Lam noted that in recent years, there have been certain politicians with ulterior purposes who have gained posts in the Hong Kong government by exploiting loopholes in the electoral system. But instead of assisting with the government's work, those politicians carried out sabotage, and even assisted foreign forces to interfere in the city's affairs."This [LegCo elections] is an internal affair of Hong Kong, and also an internal affair of China, which foreign countries should not intervene in at all," Lam said during an interview with Hong Kong Commercial Daily. "When foreign politicians intervene, they often say 'we stand with Hong Kong' and 'we support the Hong Kong people'," Lam said. "But if Hong Kong people accept a sound electoral system and do not welcome foreign intervention, what basis and excuse do foreign politicians have to block Hong Kong's development?"Lam said she is undaunted by possible further sanctions from foreign governments. "At this turning point in history, it is an honorable mission as an official of the HKSAR to be able to have some influence on the protection of national security," said Lam. Whether it is Hong Kong's national security law or electoral reform, they can provide the city with a more stable environment both as an externally oriented economy and as a business city, Lam said.Lam also said she has not considered the matter of seeking re-election. "I really think there is still a huge amount of work to be done now [before considering that question]," she said in an interview with Phoenix TV.Global Times
