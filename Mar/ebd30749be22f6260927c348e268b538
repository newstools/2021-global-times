Elections are not scheduled until 2023.The HDP said prosecutors acted on political orders and accused the ruling AK Party of shaping politics through the courts."The closure case launched against our party is a heavy blow to democracy and law," the HDP said in a statement, adding that its "determined struggle for democratic politics" would continue.The embattled lira extended losses on concerns about the political impact of the move, weakening 2 percent to 7.64 against the dollar."[The HDP] move together with the PKK terrorist group and other linked organizations, they act as a branch of the organization with the aim of breaking the unity of the state," Turkish appeals court chief prosecutor Bekir Sahin said in a statement.Reuters
