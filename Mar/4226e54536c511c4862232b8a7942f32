Otherwise, they will face disqualification and be banned from participating in elections for five years. The HKSAR government on February 9 also noted it planned to establish a civil service college to enhance the understanding of the civil service on national affairs and the constitutional order of the HKSAR. The college is expected to train 10,000 civil servants each year.
