A stark divide in people's use of COVID-19-related technology such as contact-tracing apps risks disenfranchising some of Britain's most disadvantaged communities, researchers said on Thursday, calling for a more inclusive approach to digital health.

Britain is reviewing the idea of vaccine certificates allowing travel.
