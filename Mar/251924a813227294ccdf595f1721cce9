Highlights of Chinese Premier's Press Conference Infographic: Yu Tianjiao, Wu Tiantong/GTChinese Premier Li Keqiang on Thursday addressed a series of challenges in various areas of the country's economic and social development, including great uncertainties for growth, mounting pressure on employment and weaknesses in fundamental research, striking a sobering note over potential risks for the world's second-largest economy even as it remains on a world-leading robust recovery path.During the wide-ranging briefing, which capped the closing of the legislative and political consultative sessions, or the two sessions, the premier was notably upfront about the challenges and specific about policy initiatives to address them. Commenting on the country's decision to set a GDP growth target of above 6 percent, compared with a forecast of around 8-percent growth, Li defended the move as "sustainable" and cautioned against setting the target too high and creating "wild swings" that could undermine market expectations."We certainly want to see the economy improve, but we are also soberly aware that this year is moving forward on the basis of restorative growth and there are many incomparable factors, and the world economic recovery is still uncertain," Li said, adding that 6-percent growth is "not low" for an economy of 100 trillion yuan ($15.42 trillion).The comment is likely aimed at painting an objective picture of the country's slowing but still massive growth potential in the face of both internal and external downward pressure from the COVID-19 pandemic, trade tensions and other woes, analysts said.

But experts said that the target is still low compared with actual demand in the labor market. Like other economies such as the EU and the US, jobs are also the top priority for China because the outcome directly relates to consumption, Tian said. "The trajectory of policy adjustments in the Chinese economy is relatively clear… which is led by employment," he said.For 2021, Li said that in addition to promoting current job measures, more "flexible" job channels will be opened up. "We believe that through the steady recovery of economic growth, more jobs will be created, and more jobs will promote the stability and improvement of the economy," he said.Li also addressed other challenges faced by the economy, including weaknesses in fundamental research, which poses a direct hurdle for the country's ambitious goal to become independent in core technologies. "Over the years, China has made major breakthroughs in technology and innovation. It has also developed rapidly in the field of applied innovation, but there are indeed deficiencies in the field of basic research," Li said.But the premier warned against seeking "quick success" and called for steady "step-by-step" efforts, while suggesting that investment in basic research could increase significantly from its current level of 6 percent of GDP.Also in line with an overall opening tone at the press conference, Li reiterated that China's drive for independence does not run counter to international cooperation. "Isolation has no future. Broken chains are no good for anyone," he said.
