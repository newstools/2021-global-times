Leaked videos of staff from Australia's conservative government performing sex acts in parliament, including one man masturbating over a female MP's desk, left Scott Morrison's administration facing yet another major scandal Tuesday.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison speaks during a press conference on March 05, 2021 in Sydney, Australia. Sex Discrimination Minister Kate Jenkins has been appointed to lead a review into workplace culture at Parliament House.

And earlier in March, Attorney-General Christian Porter vigorously denied swirling accusations he had raped a 16-year-old girl in 1988 when they were both students.
