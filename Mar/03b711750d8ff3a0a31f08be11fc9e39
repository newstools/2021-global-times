The event has been held successfully for 10 years, she said, noting that the Chinese Language Day, which falls on April 20, could become the "Chinese Characters Day."The day will help promote the correct use of common language for the majority of young people, and refine the culture and national pride, which is also an important part of patriot education, An said. According to the deputy, the international influence of Chinese language still needs to be improved. For example, in the field of science and technology, Chinese is not a language used in major conferences in the world, and Chinese journals are hardly recognized in the academic research world.Studies have shown that the use of the Chinese language in the UN system is limited and has only been fully recognized in some specialized agencies of the organization."In order to timely and accurately convey the values of contemporary China, we must also enhance the influence of Chinese language and completely break the discourse monopoly of the West," An said.
