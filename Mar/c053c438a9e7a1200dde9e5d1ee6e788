As of press time, China's box office in 2021 was approaching 17 billion yuan ($2.62 billion) and 7.8 billion yuan of that came during the 2021 Chinese New Year holiday. In the leisure travel sector, China's civil aviation regulator said that passenger traffic in February was 23.95 million trips, a gain of 187.1 percent from the same period last year. The regulator vowed to bring passenger transport back to around 90 percent of the level before the epidemic, and it will try to reduce losses and increase profits for aviation companies.
