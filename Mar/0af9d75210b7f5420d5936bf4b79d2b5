Hong Kong Photo: VCGOrganizations and officials from both the mainland and Hong Kong voiced their supports for the National People's Congress (NPC)'s approval to improve Hong Kong's electoral system, saying such reform is justified and progressive, and will promote the city's long-term stability and prosperity.Chinese lawmakers voted on Thursday to adopt a decision on improving the electoral system of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) at the closing of the fourth session of the 13th NPC, the country's top legislature, in a move to fix the loopholes in Hong Kong's governance. The decision made by the NPC on improving the electoral system of Hong Kong will help ensure "patriots governing Hong Kong" and the steady and sustained development of the "one country, two systems,"  Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said in a press conference on Thursday, following the closing session of the NPC.A spokesperson of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong said that the decision has unchallenged authority from the NPC, based on the development of the "one country, two systems" principle, and aims to better HKSAR's electoral system at the constitutional level. The decision is also progressive as it expands the number of members of the Election Committee and seats of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region.This has guaranteed orderly and balanced political participation in the Hong Kong society and safeguarded Hong Kong residents' democratic rights, according to the spokesperson. He  noted that after the electoral reform, the city will walk out of its long-existing "political swamp," and solve its deep-rooted problems and conflicts.Hong Kong society has been paying close attention to Hong Kong-related proposals at the NPC, said the spokesperson. It is not only officials who have voiced their firm support for the central government's decision, ordinary Hong Kong residents also launched an online petition to implement "patriots governing Hong Kong and support for improving Hong Kong's electoral system."The Legislative Affairs Commission of the NPC's Standing Committee also issued a statement that spoke highly of the decision, noting that the commission will launch rectification of the annex of the Basic Law as soon as possible and will draw advice and opinions from all walks of life to make sure it provides strong and reliable legal guarantees to safeguard "one country, two systems."Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council issued a statement on Thursday, saying that the NPC’s decision has provided a systematic guarantee to fully implement the principle for “patriots governing Hong Kong.” Since recent years, especially the riots in 2019, there have been repeated cases in Hong Kong that damaged the city’s legal system and endangered not only national sovereignty, but also Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability, according to the statement, which added that the NPC’s decision will help eradicate such political chaos in the city.The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also issued a statement on Thursday night saying that China will unwaveringly insist in the implementation of “one country, two systems,” and its determination to oppose interference by foreign forces in China’s domestic affairs won’t be shaken.HKSAR's Chief Executive Carrie Lam expressed gratitude toward the NPC's approval on reforming Hong Kong's electoral system, saying the HKSAR will provide advice on their views on the composition of the five sectors of the Election Committee, with a view to ensuring that the committee fulfills its requirements of being broadly representative and reflecting the overall interests of the Hong Kong society.The Hong Kong Research Association on Wednesday published a survey among 1,008 Hong Kong residents aged above 18, which shows that 78 percent of the respondents believe that "patriots governing Hong Kong" will help the implementation of "one country two systems," while 69 percent support the NPC's decision.Paul Chan Mo-po, financial secretary of Hong Kong, on Thursday stood on the street and urged passing-by Hong Kong residents to join him and sign for support of the NPC's decision. Hong Kong Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah said on Thursday that she welcomes and supports the decision, describing it as a "no time to delay" action. She said the HKSAR government will fully cooperate and implement the follow-up work, including explaining the decision to the public, and putting together local legislatures as soon as possible.Cheng said that the Hong Kong government is also making sure elections in the coming 12 months go smoothly.Hong Kong's Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung Kin-chung also said that there will be multiple elections in the 12 months to come, so the central government's measures to fix the current loopholes in Hong Kong's electoral system are desperately needed.All the pro-establishment lawmakers in Hong Kong supported the NPC's decision. Also, several Hong Kong authorities, including the Hong Kong security bureau, as well as the Hong Kong police force, said they support the NPC's decision, and will unwaveringly carry out their responsibility to uphold national sovereignty, security and development interests. The spokesperson from the liaison office said that the central government has taken a great deal of care on bettering Hong Kong's electoral system, and hopes people from all walks of life in the city will give their advice on local legislation work, and become united to make sure "one country, two systems" moves steadily and further. Global Times
