The coronavirus pandemic reversed women's workplace gains in many of the world's wealthiest countries as the burden of childcare rose and female-dominated sectors shed jobs, according to research released on Tuesday.Women were more likely than men to lose their jobs in 17 of the 24 rich countries where unemployment rose in 2020, according to the latest annual PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Women in Work Index.
