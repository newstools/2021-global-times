Efforts to close the gender pay gap risk stalling as countries recover from COVID-19, researchers said on Monday as a global poll showed almost a quarter of men thought the issue was "political correctness gone too far."Although the survey spanning 28 countries revealed nearly eight in 10 people considered it important to tackle wage differences between men and women, almost half of them did not think it should be a top priority during the health crisis. More than one in 10 men said tackling the pay gap was not important, according to the poll published on International Women's Day by Ipsos MORI and the Global Institute for Women's Leadership (GIWL) at King's College London.

Poll respondents said more flexible working practices and greater support for domestic abuse victims should be top priorities for ensuring that COVID-19 recovery efforts address issues facing women.Globally, women are paid about 16 percent less than men, according to UN Women.The poll of 20,520 people across Europe, the Americas, Asia and the Middle East showed 42 percent thought closing the gap was important, but should not be prioritized right now, compared with 36 percent who thought it should be.Support was highest in Chile, South Africa and France, and lowest in Russia, the Netherlands and the US.On pay transparency, more than half of respondents thought workers had the right to know what colleagues doing similar jobs were paid, with support slightly higher among women than men.The European Union said on Friday there was "ample evidence" that hard-won gender equality gains had been rolled back.Half of people polled in the GIWL survey thought things would return to how they were pre-pandemic as countries recover. But 19 percent in Germany, Spain and Turkey thought the crisis would set things back for women, while 38 percent in Saudi Arabia thought women's position would improve.
