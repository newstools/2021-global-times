We have objections related to the distribution of illegal content. They failed to fulfill legitimate requirements of the Russian authorities, so we implemented measures that are envisioned by the law. However, our claims remain unanswered, no one established contact with us, we got no reply to our requests," Zaytsev told the Russian Civic Chamber.Roskomnadzor is "ready for any kind of dialogue," the official stressed, noting that Twitter can appeal to a Russian court if it has some counter claims.On Wednesday, the watchdog announced its decision to temporarily slow down Twitter's speed on all mobile phones and on half of desktop devices in Russia over the US social media company's failure to delete banned content.
