However, she has males' Y chromosome, that is to say, Pingping is genetically a male. Besides, her doctor failed to find hidden testes in her body which the doctor suggested might have degraded and shrank. After careful examinations, Pingping was diagnosed with a congenital disease that might be the result of her parents' intermarriage between relatives. Pingping was advised by her doctor to consult with mental health specialists for the direction of her future life. Global Times
