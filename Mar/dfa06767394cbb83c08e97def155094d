Amazon is digging into allegations made in the lawsuit, the spokeswoman added.Newman said she was hired as a public policy manager at Amazon four years ago, quickly doing work typically assigned to higher level employees and paid less than white coworkers.In June 2020 she filed a written complaint about harassment by a male executive.
