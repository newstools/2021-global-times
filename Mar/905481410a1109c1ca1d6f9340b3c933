How to build a high-quality 5G network with wide coverage, fast speed and good service experience at a low cost is an important issue.Last year, more than 1,100 5G+ industrial internet projects were launched, including a 5G-based remote consultation that was used in more than 60 hospitals in 19 provinces. New products and services that require 5G are emerging, such as 5G+ autonomous driving, 5G+ smart grid, and 5G+ online education.“During the fight against the COVID-19 epidemic last year, we all saw the support found in the digital economy. Online education, medical care services, family interactions, and online shopping have all been effectively guaranteed through the digital economy,” Xiao said.“The development of China’s digital economy is in a growing phase and the future prospects are very broad,” he added.Meanwhile, the minister stressed the importance to prevent any duplication of projects in the newly emerging strategic areas such as microchips and 5G networks.“The development of new industries should not rush up and should be done in an orderly manner, in accordance with market regulations and under the rule of law,” Xiao said.Global Times
