China vowed to revise the anti-monopoly law during the just-ended Two Sessions - and for the first time in the central government work report, China said that it will step up efforts against business monopolies to ensure fair market competition.As China has vowed to open its market ever wider, the entry of foreign companies will add diversity to the market."China has been opening up its market, but there could be more room for foreign investment to enter the ICT sector. In the future, there may be more European companies entering in the form of joint ventures to increase diversity," said Depoux, hinting that there is more chance for European companies, as the China-US relationship is entering a new and tense phase where the two countries are economic competitors, while they can also be partners on some global issues. In the first two months of 2021, China's actual use of foreign investment reached 176.76 billion yuan ($27.14 billion), up 31.5 percent year-on-year. Investment from the EU increased 31.5 percent on a yearly basis and that from ASEAN was up by 28.1 percent, according to statistics from the Ministry of Commerce."Most of our global clients are particularly interested, in these tough times, by a very active Chinese market across multiple industries. They also realize that given domestic dynamism, local preferences and the geopolitical context, it makes sense to further localize in China," Depoux said in a recent written interview with the Global Times.
