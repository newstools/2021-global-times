A poll by the Asahi Shimbun daily found that 85 percent of respondents think overseas fans should be barred from the event, with only 11 percent saying they should be allowed to attend.The poll, which received responses from 1,564 people on Saturday and Sunday, found that less than one third of respondents (27 percent) think the Games should be held this summer. The majority said they think the event should either be postponed again (36 percent) or canceled (33 percent).Games organizers insist another postponement is out of the question. The latest figures suggest support for the Games is slowly growing in Japan, finding just 11 percent thought they should go ahead this summer, rising to 21 percent in February.
