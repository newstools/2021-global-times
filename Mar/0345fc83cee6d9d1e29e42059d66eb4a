In addition to the electronic display, it can also be printed.The certificate includes nucleic acid testing and serum antibody results, vaccine inoculation and other information. It has an encrypted code to allow authorities to verify the holder's personal information, according to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. While it may take time to set up an international platform, experts said it is very possible and practical for China to start mutual recognition with countries that had approved Chinese vaccines, such as Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia; or some neighboring countries that have practical needs for resuming exchanges, such as South Korea and Japan; or regional organizations such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations; or any other country that is willing to cooperate with China in this regard.Global Times
