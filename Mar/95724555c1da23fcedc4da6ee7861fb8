Net profits fell 17.25 percent to 4.26 billion yuan last year, per its disclosure, while net profits excluding extraordinary gains or losses soared 113.66 percent to reach 1.04 billion yuan."In terms of chipsets, advanced manufacturing technology, packaging and joint software/hardware design can help overcome the bottleneck of Moore's Law," Xu said in a keynote speech to the Mobile World Congress Shanghai 2021 in late February.Considering algorithms as the key to higher software quality and efficiency, Xu pledged to "focus on high cohesion at the physical layer, ultimate performance at the network layer, and feature optimization at the service layer, and continue to improve the artificial intelligence algorithm library."This will result in continuous improvement in chipsets and algorithms, as well as revolutionary progress in architecture, according to the telecom industry veteran, who said the company welcomes deep and open cooperation with its ecosystem partners.Global Times
