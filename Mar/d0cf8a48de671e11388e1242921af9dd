Jury selection was delayed on Monday in the high-profile trial of the white police officer accused of killing George Floyd, a black man whose death was captured on video and sparked mass protests against racial injustice in the US and around the world.

People gather in a Manhattan park to protest on the first day of the trial for the killing of George Floyd last May on March 08, in New York City.

Second-degree murder carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison while the lesser charge of third-degree murder carries 25 years.The visibly impatient judge said he believed selection of the 12 jurors and four alternates should go ahead but he agreed to hold off while the appeal is pending. He later said jury selection would begin at 9:00 am Central Time (1500 GMT) on Tuesday. "Unless the court of appeals tells me otherwise we're going to keep moving," the judge said.
