"Currently, the instability and uncertainty that challenge international security are rising; COVID-19 ravages the world; hegemony, power politics and unilateralism are gaining ground sometimes; there are constant regional conflicts and wars, and the international security system and order are being impacted," said Wu.He also noted that China is facing risks to its homeland security, which include unresolved territorial disputes, conflicts in insular territories and maritime delimitation, as well as the Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party, who stubbornly insists on Taiwan secessionism, posing the biggest threat to cross-Straits peace and stability.At the same time, Wu pointed to the high expectations of the international community on China's contribution to public security products. China's participation on UN peacekeeping operations, regular naval escorts and other actions have won praises from the international community. During the COVID-19 outbreak, the Chinese military has helped other countries by providing vaccines and sending medical expert teams.History will prove that the Chinese military will always be a reliable force to maintain world peace. The increase of the defense budget will help to preserve China's security, as well as the safety of international community. For this reason, it is reasonable and undisputable, Wu stressed.
