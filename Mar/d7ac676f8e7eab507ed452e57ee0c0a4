The United States and South Korea held multiple rounds of negotiations on the 11th SMA, but they failed to reach an agreement following the former U.S. administration demanded a sharp increase in Seoul's contribution.Since 1991, South Korea has shared the upkeep cost for U.S. soldiers, including costs for South Korean civilians hired by the U.S. Forces Korea (USFK), construction of military installations, and logistics support.Currently, about 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea.
