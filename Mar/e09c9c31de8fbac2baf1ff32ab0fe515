It is a completely new standard of living," he said, announcing other infrastructure projects in the city of Valjevo.Noting that infrastructure is one of the most important areas of cooperation between China and Serbia, the Chinese ambassador expressed confidence that the results in that area will be even better."We have all heard that the project will be completed before the agreed deadline," Chen said, adding that Chinese companies can share their experience and technology with their Serbian partners and contribute to Serbia's economic development."I am convinced that we will achieve more results in that area," she added.
