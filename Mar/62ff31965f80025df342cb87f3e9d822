This is yielding results with more and more deposits and loans in rubles. Citizens trust this currency," she said.Despite such efforts, the U.S. dollar will remain in circulation as it continues to be attractive, Matviyenko said.In the latest move to diversify its investments, the Russian Finance Ministry announced last week that the Chinese yuan and the Japanese yen had been included in the regulatory currency structure of Russia's National Wealth Fund.The yuan accounts for 15 percent and the yen 5 percent of the fund's foreign currency portfolio, while the U.S. dollar and euro have been lowered from 45 percent to 35 percent each.
