Eating dirt will not earn us understanding but will only further intensify things, so we have to fight back,” the translator noted, adding that he considers himself just one speck of dust among a huge number of patriotic netizens.Another rap song created by rapper Jian-Ajian that takes aim at H&M also went viral on social media earlier than “Nike H&M” and earned warm support from netizens.
