Chinese analysts said at the time that the so-called behavior by China is actually related to China's sovereignty or core interests, and most frictions were triggered by provocation from the US or its allies, so it is they who should rethink how to reduce the negative impact on the region that could create more instability.Reiterating the routine nature of the operation, Song said that the PLA’s training is not targeted at Japan or the US, but these countries will likely perceive it that way because they see China as their imaginary enemy.The PLA needs to boost its combat capability in distant seas to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests in an uncertain and unstable world, with external threats from a small circle led by the US, Song said.With a displacement of more than 12,000 tons, the Type 055 is a guided missile destroyer about 180 meters long, 22 meters wide and has 112 vertical launch missile cells capable of launching a combination of surface-to-air missiles, anti-ship missiles, land-attack missiles and anti-submarine missiles, and the warship is also endowed with the capability to gain strong situational awareness, media reports said previously, leading analysts to say that the Type 055 is one of the world’s most powerful warships, if not the most powerful one.A total of eight Type 055s have reportedly been built, with two of them known to have entered service. As the first entry to the Type 055-class, the Nanchang entered service on January 12, 2020, and the second ship Lhasa in early 2021.
