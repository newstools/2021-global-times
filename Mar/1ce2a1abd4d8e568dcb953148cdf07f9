Hong Kong Police Wanchai district headquarters File Photo: XinhuaLess than 10 police officers in China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) have resigned after refusing to take the oath or sign the declaration to uphold the Basic Law, local media Sing Tao Daily reported on Sunday, citing Assistant Commissioner of Police Ronny Chan Man-tak.These people's resignation is not causing a loss to the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF); instead their leaving can be good to both themselves and the HKPF, Chan mentioned. Since last year, the HKSAR government arranged for all civil servants to take the oath or sign the declaration, pledging to uphold the HKSAR Basic Law, bear allegiance to the HKSAR and be responsible to the HKSAR government, in accordance with the HKSAR Basic Law, the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the HKSAR and other relevant laws and regulations.Earlier this month, the Secretary for the Civil Service in Hong Kong, Patrick Nip, said at a press conference that civil servants who refuse to take the oath or sign the declaration, will be asked by the government to resign in accordance with relevant mechanisms and procedures.Nip said that about 200 people have not signed the declaration, and he will explain the situation at the Legislative Council of the HKSAR in April.The HKPF previously have announced to allow members who entered the force before June 1, 2000, to postpone their retirement until they turn 60 years old to deal with a shortage of hands.  Chan said that about 120,000 Hong Kong police officers are qualified for the new policy. He noted that these veteran officers can stay and get promoted, but this would not affect the promotion of young officers.
