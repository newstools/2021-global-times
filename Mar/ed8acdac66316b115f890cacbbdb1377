In the next two weeks, priority will be given to the entry of Israelis ahead of the general elections scheduled on March 23. Before then, the entry of foreign citizens will be approved on a limited basis.In March 2020, Israel banned entry of foreign nationals into Israel, following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. Since July of the year, the ban has been gradually eased, with permissions being given to family events, business meetings and more circumstances.However, on Dec. 21, 2020, Israel completely banned entry of foreign nationals due to the increase in infections. On Jan. 26, 2021, Israel closed Ben Gurion International Airport for most inbound and outbound flights to avoid the spread of the new strains of the virus.
