Cooperation reached during Wang Yi's visit to the Middle East.

China also sent medical teams and held video conferences to aid the region's fight against the coronavirus.Such cooperation amid a large-scale health crisis, including joint vaccine development as a shining chapter, further escalated China's relations with regional countries and boosted mutual trust, which paves the way for cooperation in more areas, Hua said. Li noted that as Mideast countries continue their economic recovery in the post-pandemic area, China has established cooperation with them in various fields, laying the foundation for their economic recovery.Such cooperation will further stimulate the desire of both sides to continue the model and guarantee sustainable cooperation, Li told the Global Times.Before the UAE, Wang had visited Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Iran. He left for Bahrain on Monday and will conclude his tour with a visit to Oman on Tuesday. During his tour, Wang not only discussed issues such as regional security and stability, but also nailed down concrete cooperation ranging from traditional energy imports and exports, as well as new fields including 5G, big data, artificial intelligence and public health. Among them, the signing of a 25-year cooperation agreement with Iran received the highest attention.
