Aramco said then that the attack on the North Jeddah Bulk Plant hit a storage tank but did not affect supplies.The movement, which controls northern Yemen, has struck Saudi energy assets in the past. In November 2020, the Saudi energy ministry said a limited fire broke out near a floating platform belonging to the Jazan oil products terminal after a foiled attack using explosive-laden boats in the southern Red Sea.The Houthis have recently stepped up cross-border drone and missile attacks on Saudi cities, mostly targeting southern Saudi Arabia. The coalition says it intercepts most attacks.Earlier on Thursday, the coalition said it destroyed an armed drone launched toward the southern city of Khamis Mushait, state media reported. The Houthi's Sarea said in a separate Twitter post that the Khamis Mushait attack targeted a military site.The coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 after the Houthis ousted the internationally recognized government from power in the capital, Sanaa.The US and UN have renewed peace efforts as fighting also intensified in Yemen's gas-rich Marib region. Reuters
