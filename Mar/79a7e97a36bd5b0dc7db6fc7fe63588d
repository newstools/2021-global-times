She said she looked forward to engaging in diplomacy with the relevant countries, as well as reaching out to the private sector.Administration officials including Roberta Jacobson, special assistant to the president and coordinator for the southwest border, and Juan Gonzalez, the National Security Council's senior director for the Western Hemisphere, traveled to Mexico and Guatemala this week to discuss with officials there plans to stop migrants from fleeing the countries.
