Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen speaks during the "Double Ten" address in Taipei. Photo: AFPThings will develop in the opposite direction when they become extreme - Hong Kong's extreme opposition forces have despised this fact. They acted arrogantly, and then they faced the national security law for Hong Kong. Hong Kong's situation completely reversed. Hopefully, Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities can seriously draw lessons from this and stop repeating the same foolish mistakes of Hong Kong's extreme opposition forces.The DPP authorities are trying to adopt the "salami cutting tactics" toward Taiwan secessionism. They believe that the Chinese mainland cannot do anything about them, and that they have US support. They should not act recklessly or go too far. The mainland still sticks to its policy of peaceful reunification and it has not used any real tough measure. But if the mainland makes up its mind to take actions, it will not care about the Taiwan military's deterrence or the US' so-called support at all. The situation may change suddenly overnight.DPP authorities should be realistic and meet the mainland's cross-Straits policies halfway. When it is time to take a step back, the DPP should have the courage to do so instead of blindly acting tough. This will be good for Taiwan and it will also be the best for the DPP itself.The author is editor-in-chief of the Global Times. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn
