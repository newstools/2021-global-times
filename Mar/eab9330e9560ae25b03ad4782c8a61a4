(Photo: Xinhua)Former and current officials in Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region strongly condemned and rebuked the so-called sanctions by the US, Canada, the UK and the EU against them, saying the sanctions "are nothing but a piece of wastepaper," as they have no assets in those countries and regions, nor do they want to go there.The US, Canada and the UK joined the EU on Monday to take what they described as "coordinated action" against China, which contains travel bans and asset freezes on senior Chinese officials, including Wang Mingshan, a former member of the Standing Committee of the CPC (Communist Party of China) in Xinjiang; Zhu Hailun, former deputy Party secretary in Xinjiang; Chen Mingguo, director of the Xinjiang Public Security Department and Wang Junzheng, a political commissar of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps.The sanctions, based on lies and false information, are a gross slander and an affront to the reputation and dignity of the Chinese people, a flagrant interference in China's internal affairs, and a grave violation of China's sovereignty and security interests, Wang Junzheng said. "It has severely trampled on the international laws and the basic norms of international relations," he noted.The sanctions "are nothing but a piece of wastepaper," and a self-inflicted humiliation [to these Western countries], Wang Junzheng remarked, urging the countries and regions involved to stop their disgusting, ugly farce.Wang Mingshan said he feels ridiculous about the sanctions being imposed on him. "My family and I don't want to go to these countries at all, and we don't have any assets abroad," he said. The sanctions are futile and will not shake the firm will and resolve of Xinjiang officials to promote counter-terrorism and de-radicalization in the region and to maintain lasting peace and stability there, Wang Mingshan added."I will not go to these countries, nor do I have any assets in these countries, and sanctions against me have no meaning," Zhu Hailun responded.The so-called sanctions are nothing more than a farce staged by some anti-China politicians, he added.No slander can stop the process of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. No rumors can obliterate the fact that Xinjiang's human rights cause is progressing, and no conspiracy can shake the determination of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang to fight in unity, he noted."I am very proud of being sanctioned by these countries," said Chen Mingguo. In recent years, through the fight against terrorism and de-radicalization in accordance with the law, people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have lived and worked happily and no longer have to worry about being threatened by terrorism and extremism.However, the EU, the US, the UK and Canada have turned a deaf ear to the facts. Instead, they spread false information and interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. "We are more confident and determined than ever to maintain social stability and long-term stability in Xinjiang," Chen noted.Global Times
