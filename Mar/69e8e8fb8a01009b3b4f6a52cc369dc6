"We need clear decisions and a clear course in the fight against the coronavirus." The first order of business should be to decide the bloc's candidate for chancellor, media outlet Spiegel said.New CDU chief Armin Laschet is the obvious choice but he lacks broad support.Critics say he has failed to carve out a political profile beyond representing continuity in the post-Merkel era.Laschet needs to "free himself from Merkel's shadow" and "say what the party stands for," Andreas Roedder, a historian at Mainz university and a CDU member, told the Bild daily.AFP
