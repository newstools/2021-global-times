The UN Security Council on Friday approved a resolution allowing almost 3,000 more peacekeepers to deploy in the Central African Republic (CAR), which is still under threat from armed groups trying to overthrow the government.

That will bring the total number of forces deployed in the country to 14,400 soldiers and 3,020 police, to strengthen MINUSCA's ability to implement its priority mandated tasks.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in February that "the Central African Republic is at a critical juncture that will determine if peace and stability will be restored and put on a firmer footing."The Security Council also adopted a resolution extending its peacekeeping mission in South Sudan until March 15, 2022, without changing its strength despite a recent study recommending it be reduced to 15,000 troops from the current 17,000. In February, President Salva Kiir and Vice President Riek Machar, for years on opposing sides of the battlefield, formed a coalition government after nearly a year of delay and haggling along with international pressure.The cease-fire they agreed upon still largely holds, but observers say it is under increasing strain. The US-drafted resolution was approved unanimously, diplomatic sources said.
