A $2 trillion group of investors on Monday urged the European Commission to be more ambitious in its planned overhaul of the bloc's huge farming subsidy program to fight climate change and protect biodiversity.

FAIRR said it would consult its members, who manage a collective $30 trillion, on further areas of engagement on the issue.
