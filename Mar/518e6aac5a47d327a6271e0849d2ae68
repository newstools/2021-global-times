We have repeatedly commented on this American policy, which is devoid of logic and meaning and only more and more worsens bilateral relations," it read.The ministry said Russia will retaliate based on the principle of reciprocity and continue to resolutely defend its national interests.The ministry asked the United States to honor its obligations and destroy chemical weapons, which Russia does not have since 2017.The United States has been deprived of the moral right to lecture others since it is a serial violator of international treaties and agreements in the field of arms control and non-proliferation, it said.
