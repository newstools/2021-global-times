The valley is dubbed as a "Natural Vegetation Museum" because it is home to almost all terrestrial vegetation types from the tropics to the arctic zone, including some rare and even unique species.It is also a habitat for many endangered animals, such as clouded leopards, snow leopards and red gorals. It is China's only confirmed habitat for Bengal tigers.However, due to climate change and human activities, the ecosystem at the Yarlung Zangbo River faces threats and challenges.The Tibet Autonomous Region has more than 60 regulations and laws involving environmental and ecological protection, according to a statement Tibet's delegation to the two sessions sent to the Global Times on Wednesday.Around 45 percent of the area in the region is under protection within ecological "red lines." The region has built 47 natural reserves, accounting for more than 34 percent of the region's area, it said.Moreover, Tibet has been turning woodcutters  into forest rangers. Since 2016, more than 700,000 positions in environmental protection have been provided in the region.Kunming, capital of Southwest China's Yunnan Province, which neighbors Tibet, will host the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity in May.If approved, the establishment of the Yarlung Tsangbo national park in Tibet will demonstrate China's resolution and endeavor to the whole world in preserving biodiversity, Zhang added.
