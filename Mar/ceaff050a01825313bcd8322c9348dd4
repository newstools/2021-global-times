APEC is the summit that binds the FTA economies together that we want to build on and create the foundation for a prosperous and dynamic region," said him at the press conference. He noted that the summit will respond to the immediate crisis faced by the region, such as how to move medical products around and ensure a more convenient flow of vaccines across the Asia-Pacific region. Experts told the Global Times that this year's APEC could be a chance for China and the US to break the ice and seek more common ground for cooperation, considering that US President Joe Biden has shown an inclination to embrace multilateralism again after the exclusionary mindset in the Trump era. "With Biden showing an intention to cooperate with other countries, and with the start of the RCEP, there's plenty of room for China-US bilateral cooperation and multilateral cooperation, which can be raised and pushed during the APEC summit," Chen Fengying, a research fellow at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times. Zhao Gancheng, director of the Center for Asia-Pacific Studies at the Shanghai Institute for International Studies, said that it's hoped China and the US will find ways to cooperate and emerge from the shadows under the APEC framework, as long as Biden does not waver on his multilateral stance."If the US opens its arms to free trade, I believe China will actively respond to that," he told the Global Times.He also noted that China will be an initiator on many issues for promoting cooperation during this year's APEC, such as urging other members to speed up implementation of the RCEP. Chen predicted that this year's APEC will focus on implementing the APEC Putrajaya Vision 2040, which was reached at last year's APEC summit -- a move under which member economies will work together to deliver a free, open, fair, non-discriminatory trade and investment environment.
