In serious circumstances, the offenders shall be detained for five to 10 days and fined between 200 yuan and 500 yuan.Many Chinese netizens criticized their behavior on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo by ridiculing that they seemed to carve their names on tombstones. Others believed such behaviors should be severely punished with prison sentences.A netizen commented that "their names will not be famous for thousands of years but will go down in history as a symbol of infamy."Since the rollout of the Punishment Measures for the Destruction of Cultural Relics at Badaling Great Wall Scenic Spot last April, several tourists have been fined, put into administrative detention and their uncivilized behaviors recorded when traveling. Twelve tourist attractions in Yanqing district have jointly punished tourists by banning them from future entry.Global Times
