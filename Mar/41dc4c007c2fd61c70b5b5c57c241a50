(Xinhua/Xing Guangli)China vows to work harder to improve the conduct of its ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) and build a clean government, according to a government work report submitted Friday to the national legislature for deliberation.It promises to intensify efforts to continue to prevent misconduct and corruption, emphasizing that government staff must readily subject themselves to the oversight of the law, supervisory bodies, and the people, Premier Li Keqiang said in delivering the work report."We will boost development of a government based on the rule of law and ensure transparency in all government affairs," the work report said. Government staff will subject themselves to the oversight of the legislative body, people's congresses, and their standing committees at the corresponding level, and readily submit to the democratic oversight of the CPPCC (Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference), public oversight, and oversight through public opinion, while strengthening auditing-based oversight, according to the report."We must guard against pointless formalities and bureaucratism and one-size-fits-all approaches in our work, so as to truly lighten the burden on all those working on the ground," it noted.Although remarkable achievements have been made in China's economic and social development, China still has quite a way to go, read the report. "We must bear in mind the reality that China is still in the primary stage of socialism and run our affairs well," it said.The report noted that the people must always be uppermost in the minds of government staff. "We must take a fact-based approach, and pursue development and improve in people's lives in a realistic and pragmatic way," it said.Global Times
