Hong Kong Photo:VCGSpokesperson of the Liaison office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) issued a statement on Saturday, refuting remarks of some Western countries on China's steps of justice to promote Hong Kong's prosperity.The spokesperson said that any interference would not stop the process for Hong Kong to get rid of chaos or the firm steps for China to develop and grow.The spokesperson noted that Hong Kong residents enjoy democratic rights more than ever since the city returned to the motherland.In recent years, especially since the anti-extradition bill movement in 2019, the anti-China forces and local radicals have made use of loopholes in Hong Kong's electoral system aiming to paralyze the regional government, seize management power and conduct acts damaging national security such as overthrowing state power, the spokesperson said.The spokesperson pointed out that some Western countries and external forces should know what role they played during this process as they had been stirring up trouble and protecting law violators.   Spokesperson of the Office of the Commissioner of Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the HKSAR on Saturday also issued a statement to strongly disapprove and firmly oppose the remarks issued by a few Western countries that openly meddled with Hong Kong affairs.The spokesperson noted that the moves by the Western countries are a flagrant breach of international law and basic norms governing international relations, as they smeared the decision of China's National People's Congress (NPC) on improving the electoral system of the HKSAR.The NPC's decision is a vital step to close the loopholes in the existing system of Hong Kong, put into effect the fundamental principle of "patriots governing Hong Kong," improve the institutional framework of "one country, two systems," and protect political stability and the security of the body of power in Hong Kong, the spokesperson said.The spokesperson emphasized that the key issue in Hong Kong is not whether democracy and freedom should be upheld, but about a battle against those trying to seize power and commit subversion and infiltration. Chinese embassies in several countries including Canada, Switzerland and Denmark also expressed strong opposition to the comments made by authorities in the countries on the election system reform in Hong Kong, noting the issue is China's internal affair and no other country should interfere.The Chinese Embassy in Canada strongly opposed and expressed dissatisfaction with Canada's foreign minister who made irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong. China warned this will further damage China-Canada relations and will be met with firm countermeasures from China, the embassy said.Since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the central government has played a leading role in advancing the development of the democratic system in Hong Kong. In the course of democratic development, the electoral systems have been constantly reformed and improved in light of the realities in many countries and regions. "Hong Kong is no exception," the Chinese Embassy in Denmark said, urging the Danish government to respect facts and the rule of law.The unrest in Hong Kong in recent years have exposed the loopholes and drawbacks as well as a lack of security in Hong Kong's election system. It is never too late to make things right. We have to prevent and solve risks, read a statement of the Chinese Embassy in Switzerland. Global Times
