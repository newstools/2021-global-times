But no specific dates have been provided yet. Some netizens suspect that the re-release of these classic foreign films reflect a slowdown in releases in the Chinese mainland film market following the coveted Chinese New Year window.Chinese blockbusters Hi, Mom and Detective Chinatown 3 both announced extensions to April 11 and April 10 on Monday and Tuesday respectively. "The re-released films and the extension of the two Chinese films are all rescue measures taken by the movie market in the wake of the Spring Festival boom," said Xiao.However, Shi said the drought is mainly due to the COVID-19 global pandemic holding back Hollywood films from being released around the world, including China. He pointed out that March to June used to be the peak period for imported foreign films, but with the postponement of the Oscars from February to March as well as the impact of the pandemic on Hollywood in the US, new or award-winning foreign films are not being imported, so distributors have turned to re-releases to fill the empty window."When it comes to the summer holiday schedule, some hot Chinese films on the 100 anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China like 1921 will continue the resurgence of the Chinese film market," Shi said. Chinese director Chloe Zhao's Nomadland is scheduled for release on April 23, but the related hashtag has been recently withdrawn from Chinese social media, casting a veil of mystery on this movie's release.
