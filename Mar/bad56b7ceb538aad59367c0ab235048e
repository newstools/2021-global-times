The network is provided in the 4.9 GHz spectrum band in 14 popular locations in the Russian capital, the company said in a statement. Currently, only selected users with 5G-compatible smartphones can connect to the unlimited 5G Internet with a speed of up to 1.5 Gigabytes per second. In July 2020, MTS was granted its first 5G license, which covers 83 Russian regions and expires in July 2025.
