 By posting emoticons and making jokes online, Beijing residents tried to "seek joy in the midst of the sandstorm," showing self-deprecating humor while the whole city was engulfed by the largest sandstorm in a decade since Monday morning."When I woke up, I felt like I landed on Mars," a friend in Beijing told the Global Times reporter. "I even thought that I forgot to turn off the light before going to bed last night."The sky is full of yellow sand, adding an "orange-yellow filter" for everything on the world. A netizen joked on Sina Weibo that he realized he "forgot to ride a camel after going out."Another netizen posted before-andafter photos online. In the first picture, people ride horses neat and clean with the caption of "going to work," while they turn into unearthed terracotta warriors in the following picture when "arriving at the company."With sand and dust everywhere covering Beijing with a yellowish hue, netizens also took pictures of the city to compare with ancient Song Dynasty paintings, joking that whenever Beijing has a sandstorm, the city turns into an ancient scene.An owner of a restaurant in Beijing's Chaoyang district joked with the reporter on Monday noon, "It was never so dirty even when there were many guests coming for lunch, but today, although there are fewer guests, the dust on the floor is visible to the naked eye."The powerful sandstorm, originating from southern Mongolia has swept across much of northern China on Monday and is expected to disperse from Beijing on Tuesday.
