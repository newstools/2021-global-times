As early as in January 2020, a court in East China's Jiangxi Province ordered a copyright infringer to pay 30,000 yuan in compensation for losses of Peppa Pig's British creator. The infringer took advantage of the brand's popularity to increase the sales of unauthorized toys.eOne said that the Peppa Pig cartoon was produced by the company in 2003, which became popular around the world after its premiere.
