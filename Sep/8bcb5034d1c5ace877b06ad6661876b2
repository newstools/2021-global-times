However, hundreds still gathered despite the ban, with many shouting protest slogans and pushing down barriers set up by police. Albert Ho, vice chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance, pleaded guilty to inciting others to take part in an unauthorized assembly alongside four other Alliance members, Civil Human Rights Front former convener Figo Chan Ho-wun and Labour Party's Kwok Wing-kin.All 12 pleaded guilty to taking part in an unlawful assembly. Of the 26 defendants, the court earlier also issued arrest warrants for two other defendants in the case, activists Nathan Law and Sunny Cheung, who left Hong Kong last year.In the same case, key secessionist Joshua Wong Chi-fung and former district councilors Lester Shun, Tiffany Yuen and Jannelle Leung were sentenced to jail terms ranging from four to 10 months. Eight other defendants of this case, including the already jailed Next Digital founder Jimmy Lai Chee-ying and former chairman of the Alliance Lee Cheuk-yan pleaded not guilty. Their trial is set for November 1. Global Times
