He relocated to Belgium with his wife and children and faded into obscurity.But the 2004 release of Hotel Rwanda made Rusesabagina an overnight celebrity.He was awarded the US Presidential Medal of Freedom, and toured the globe warning of the evils of man.Over time, he increasingly used his new platform to thunder against Kagame and the RPF in fiery tirades that alienated some allies and attracted powerful enemies.He came under relentless attack, with Kagame supporters shouting him down at speaking events all over the world. Survivors from the Mille Collines turned against him, accusing Rusesabagina of profiting from their misery and embellishing his heroics.As the hounding intensified, Rusesabagina's rhetoric turned darker, said Timothy Longman, who first met the hotelier in the mid-1990s."He's always been a soft-spoken person, fairly moderate. What's happened over time, of course, is that as he was attacked, he got pushed into more extreme positions," said Longman, a professor of political science and international relations at Boston University.Enemy of the stateRusesabagina was closely involved with exiled political opposition groups.But in a 2018 video, he pledged support for the National Liberation Front - an armed group considered a terrorist organization by Rwanda."The time has come for us to use any means possible to bring about change in Rwanda, as all political means have been tried and failed," he said.Two years later, Rusesabagina boarded a plane he believed was bound for Burundi but landed instead in Rwanda. He was arrested and put on trial as an enemy of the state.Frail and bald, clad in the pink uniform worn by Rwandan prisoners, Rusesabagina has now become the focus of a global campaign led by his daughters Anaise and Carine, who on Monday told AFP she was worried he would "be killed in prison."AFP
