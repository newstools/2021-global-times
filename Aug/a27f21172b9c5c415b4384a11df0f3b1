Children under 12 are exempt because they are not currently eligible for vaccines."This is the way we bring back our city fully," De Blasio told reporters Tuesday.With enforcement a month away, the mandate appeared to start slowly but many businesses said they were on board. A sign on the door of a New York Sports Club gym on the Upper West Side said it would make "no exceptions" for unvaccinated patrons, guests and staff. "NO PROOF, NO ENTRY," screamed the notice. "Our members are regulars. They know, and they just do it," said manager Michelle Weed. "For the most part, we haven't had to remove anybody."Many New Yorkers remain traumatized by the pandemic which has killed more than 33,000 residents since it swept the city of more than 8 million in spring 2020. Some 74 percent of adults have received at least one vaccine dose, official figures show.Seventeen-year-old Thisbe said she felt safer watching a movie knowing everyone in the audience was vaccinated like her."Unvaccinated people cannot come in, but it's their choice," she said outside a theater in Greenwich Village.Not everybody spoken to by AFP supported New York's mandate, though, while some business owners fear it could turn people off."It's nonsense," said 47-year-old Samuel, who is vaccinated but believes it should be a personal choice."It's un-American. I don't like being forced to do something," he added, while eating lunch at an Irish pub in Manhattan.Other cities have followed New York's lead, including San Francisco, which will demand proof of full vaccination from Friday.At the opposite end of the spectrum are cities in Texas, which have been banned by their Republican governor from mandating vaccines.AFP
