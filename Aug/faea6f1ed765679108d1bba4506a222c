Private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) investment were strong too.The increase in M&A volume was driven mainly by industrial upgrade, and activity in nearly all sectors witnessed an increase, said the report. Cross-border inbound activities, in contrast, were adversely affected by coronavirus induced travel restrictions.Outbound M&A remained in the doldrums, negatively affected both by the pandemic and the geopolitical dispute. In volume terms, financial buyers were the biggest players in the outbound space for the first time as China-based PEs looked for overseas opportunities.China's state-owned enterprises (SOEs), on the other hand, tended to refocus their attention on the domestic market. Generally, the high-technology, industrial and consumer sectors remained the most favored sectors among Chinese buyers."Driven by strong domestic strategic and PE deal activity, the first quarter of 2021 was strong in business merges and acquisitions, but there was some relative slowing in the second quarter with some beginning to caution market uncertainties. "Deal values fell in the first half of 2021 due to fewer one-off, state-sponsored and private-sector mega-deals," said David Brown, deals leader for the Asia-Pacific region. Deal value totaled $312.1 billion in the first half, down 29 percent from its peak in the second half of 2020, returning to more normal levels, data from the report showed.There were 45 mega-deals, worth more than $1 billion, in the first half of 2021, many of which were aligned with key domestic economic themes such as industrial upgrading and dual circulation.China M&A is likely to continue to have a domestic theme in the second half, supported by the dual circulation and industrial upgrading programs and SOE reforms."The effects of the pandemic and other uncertainties around trade and geopolitical relations will continue to impact both domestic and cross-border M&A activity in the second half. "We expect a dip in the second half compared with the first half of 2021, albeit both domestic strategic and PE/VC activity will likely remain robust," said Chris Chan, PwC's financial services deals leader for the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong.  Global Times
